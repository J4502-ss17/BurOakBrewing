	<h2>Craig Stichter</h2>
	<p>Growing up in eastern Iowa along the banks of the Mississippi River, Davenport is a quiet town to raise a family with a strong work ethic and pride for community. I was born in 1965. Enjoying the art of tinkering as a child, I found myself attracted to the world of mechanical engineering and began studies at University of Iowa.
Meeting my wife Janine, we set forth on our wedded life in Tampa, FL, in pursuit of her career as a professor, prior to me completing school. </p>

	<h2>Kraig Bridgeford</h2>
<p>As a child, I spent a lot of time helping my mother cook. Being French, she cooked with beer, wine and spirits, and I gained an appreciation for food and drink at a young age. As a young man I was always fascinated by the natural world and science.
At 19 years old I met my wife Desiree, we quickly fell in love and started our life together. At our first apartment is when I first started to home brew. My neighbor gave me a home brew magazine, I was instantly intrigued and ordered a sample kit.

	<h2>Phil Fuemmeler</h2>
<p>
Raised on a northwest Missouri farm near Armstrong, Missouri (pop. 310), I learned many things, including hard work, ingenuity, and pride in my work. I also had a strong urge to “create”, and share what I had created.
While the Howard County community enjoyed their “fair share” of beer, craft beer was not to be found. I wasn’t exposed to different styles of beer until moving to Columbia to attend the University of Missouri. One day a professor inquired if anyone had any Culligan water jugs. He informed us that he used them to make beer, and would gladly take them off our hands. This was the first time I had heard of someone making their own beer and I was intrigued. After a few years of studying computer engineering I decided that it wasn’t the path for me. I started pursuing a career as a chef. Learning to combine new flavors and create new dishes was exciting and rewarding. Between work and a roommate that was always drinking new beers; I began to be exposed to new and exciting flavors and aromas that I had never expected from beer.</p>
