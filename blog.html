<p class="posteddate">Nov. 8, 2016</p>
<img class="blogimages" src="images/blog/speakthelanguage.jpg" alt="How to Speak the Language of Craft Beer" title="How to Speak the Language of Craft Beer" />
<p id="smallmargins">With all the different beer styles out there, it can be overwhelming to sort through the vocab and understand what makes one beer distinct from another. Sure, you probably know the difference in taste between a pale ale and a porter, but when your overly curious work buddy asks you if a stout is a lager, your beer brain suddenly fizzes out. So, we’ve decided to break down the ABC’s of beer to help you understand the complexities of each style. Consider this your Rosetta Stone for speaking the language of craft beer.</p>

<h2 class="heroheadline"><a class ="blogheadline" href="aromablog.html">Aroma: The Unsung Hero of Taste</a></h2>
<p class="posteddate">Aug. 19, 2016</p>
<img class="blogimages" src="images/blog/aroma.jpg" alt="Aroma" title="Aroma"/>
<p id="smallmargins">For most people, once a beer is poured and slid across the bar, the first step is to start chuggin’. Sure, you may have an appreciation for the taste, but there is a more subtle quality of beer that you might be missing out on. It’s one of the most important (and most overlooked) characteristics of beer − the smell.</p>

<h2 class="heroheadline"><a class ="blogheadline" href="goldenblog.html">Golden Ryetio</a></h2>
<p class="posteddate">July 21, 2016</p>
<img class="smallblogimage" src="images/blog/golden.png" alt="Golden Ryetio" title="Golden Ryetio"/>
<p id="smallmargins">Our brand new Golden Ryetio is a nod to the Golden Ratio found in nature and design (and now beer). The Fibonacci sequence inspired the grain bill (which includes rye malt) for this mildly sweet and well-balanced Belgian style ale. (And yes, we are aware that we are nerds. You’ll thank us when you try this beer.)</p>

Any party can offer the usual drinks, but we’re here to take yours to the next level. We’ve crafted our very own cocktail recipe and the perfect summer sangria, both of which pair the tangy flavor of orange and the sweet taste of berries. Using our summer brew Lily Ale as a base, both of these drinks have the potential to make any gathering you’re hosting a hit with all of your guests. We’re loving these new recipes, so let us know if you are too!</p>

<p id="smallmargins">Most styles of beer carry a well-defined ancestry − a consistent, surveyable history that brewers and drinkers alike can tap into to fully appreciate a certain brew. The saison, however, is a different story.</p>
